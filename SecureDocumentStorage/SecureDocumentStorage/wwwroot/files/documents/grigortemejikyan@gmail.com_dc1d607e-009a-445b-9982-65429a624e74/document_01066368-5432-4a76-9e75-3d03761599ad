Dear <<Company name>> team,

I am a junior PHP developer and interested in vacant positions in your company. Though I did not find any job announcements I decided to send my CV attached for the consideration. Would be happy to jump on for an interview or work on a task to showcase my skills.
I have solid skills in PHP and I am pretty well familiar with frontend development, SQL, GIT. I have used the mentioned skills while doing a full stack PHP internship in GITC.

In case of questions feel free to reach me out directly <<Your phone>>.

Kind regards,
Ani.
