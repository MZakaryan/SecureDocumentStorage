Dear <<Company name>> team,


I saw a job opportunity of <<position name>> in your company and became excited to apply. I have solid skills in C# and .NET framework and I am pretty well familiar with frontend development, SQL, GIT, task management tools, and a little bit familiar with agile development process. I have used the mentioned skills while doing a full stack .NET internship in MIC Armenia, where we during our studies worked on a cool and complex CRM project. 
Kindly find attached my CV for the position. Would be happy to jump on for an interview and learn more about the project you do and the job.


In case of questions feel free to reach me out directly +37498560686.

Kind regards,

Misha.
